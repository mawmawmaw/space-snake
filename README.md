# space-snake :flying_saucer::snake:

An advanced version of the classic snake game (*in space*)  

## Features
* Several difficulties to play
* Different targets to eat with different lifespan and score
  * Each fruit has it's own time before it disappears and also has it's own score
* The higher the score the faster the game
  * While your score gets higher the snake starts to accelerate
* Dynamic "asteroid barriers" are generated randomly every 50pts
